# expressively-mocked-fetch

> A fetch mock that launches express as a child_process.

## Installation

[WIP]

## Why

I saw [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw). But it was [too
static](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/287) for me. Also: Why reimplement
a whole API (express.js), when you can just use it...

## Develop

1. Download this repo and install the dependencies
2. Run `npm run test`

## Usage

See [test file](./test/index.text.js).
